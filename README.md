## About Screen Off

Android application that allows to turn screen off with an on screen icon.

## Rationale

There are lots of screen lockers on the market but there is a problem with most of them. Since Marshmallow new security policy applied which does not allow user to unlock device with fingerprint after it's been locked with "device administrator" app (most screen lockers are).

This app simply manipulates screen off timeout, works well with Android 6 Marshmallow and fingerprint scanner.
